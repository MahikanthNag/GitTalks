Facebook Quick Replies for Microsoft Bot Framework
===================

###Short sample
```js
const quick = require('botbuilder-facebook-quick-replies');

let message = new builder.Message(session)
  .text('I am a bot. Press buttons below.');
quick.replies(message, ['Yes', 'No']);
session.send(message);
```

###What's it for?
This package provides a way to add Facebook Quick Replies to your bot's message. It works with bots written in Node.js using Microsoft Bot Framework (see the `botbuilder` package).

It supports plain-text buttons, as well as buttons with different text and underlying value. Images on quick reply buttons are not yet supported.

### Most common usage

At the top of your file, add:

```js
const builder = require('botbuilder');
const quick = require('botbuilder-facebook-quick-replies');
```

Then, when you are creating a message within a dialog:

```js
// Create a plaintext message as usual:
let message = new builder.Message(session)
  .text('What do you think?');

// Now add the quick replies:
quick.replies(message, ['Cool!', 'Not bad!']);

// And send it to the user:
session.send(message);
```

This also works fine when your message contains attachments (like `HeroCard`s, rather than just plain text).

### When the bot must receive a different value from what the user sees

This is helpful when the button must tell the bot some additional parameters. 

```js
// Create a plaintext message as usual:
let message = new builder.Message(session)
  .text('Do you want to buy this product?');

// Now add the quick replies:
quick.replies(message, [
  { text: 'Buy Now', value: 'BUY #81571' },
  { text: 'Save for later', value 'SAVE #81571' },
]);

// And send it to the user:
session.send(message);
```

In this case, when the user clicks the Buy Now button, the message that the bot will actually receive is 'BUY #81571'.
